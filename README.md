The system is designed to facilitate real-time communication and provide a user-friendly interface for managing interactions with multiple users.

## Features

- List online users
- Send messages to specific users or broadcast to all users
- Manage whitelisted and blacklisted users
- Interactive command-line interface

## Technologies Used

- Java
- UDP for message transmission
- TCP for establishing connections

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java files.
2. Start the server application.
3. Run the client application with the server's host address as an argument.
